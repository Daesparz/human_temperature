# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 Celsius degrees or 98.6 Fahrenheit degrees for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

Exercises
In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance. Check the file ['inferential_statistics_exercise'](./sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_1-checkpoint.ipynb)
